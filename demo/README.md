# Demo

In this demo I've built simple React app to demonstrate the JoltSchedule module.
In order to run it, clone the repo, navigate to `../demo` and run `$ npm install` and then `$ npm start`


# Usage
![Demo pic](https://s31.postimg.org/bqowxivm3/Capture.png)
In this app you'll be able to queue tasks that will modify that app's state.
Simply, on the left box insert task name, delay time (in ms) and message to show.
The messages will appear on the right side of the screen with appropriate message.
